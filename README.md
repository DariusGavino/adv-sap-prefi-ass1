## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
	
	- Service Oriented Architechture (SOA) is stated to be a software development process that takes advantage of
	already available software or services, reusing it for the development of one's own software, it is said that 
	each block of code that was reused has its own individual function, mostly for transactional data, although it
	reusable, those "reusables" are also interoperable making it compatible to multiple programming languages and
	other supported standards.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
	
	- SOA or Service Oriented Architechture has 9 characteristics, this include:

		-Standardized Service Contract		-Loose Coupling
		-Abstraction				-Service Reusability
		-Autonomy				-Statelessness
		-Discoverability			-Composability
		-Interoperability	

	- "Standardized Service Contract" states that the services provided should comply and provide both their
	purpose, limit, and the scope of their capability, their contracts would also adhere to be operable at a 
	a standardized version that should be available for interpretation to if not all, then most.

	- "Loose Coupling" states that services reliance are minimized both internally and externally making it easy to
	place on different services and for other services to build on top of it.

	-"Abstraction",it mainly hides the complexion to users and provides only the function.

	-"Service Reusability", focuses on making the servise reusable to different devices and standard.

	-"Autonomy", describes each services ability to be independent and self managed, while maintaining their
	ability to contain or encapsulate their logic.

	-"Statelessness" states that the services are more scalable due to it naturally not storing or keeping previous
	transaction data, with this, services can be flexible having individual control, promotiing isolation.

	-"Discoverability", services contains adequate type of metadata for others to identify and discover, which would
	also explain their purpose and capability to us users.

	-"Composability", assembling individual blockes of codes or services to create a much more larger complex service
	that would give a more complex process, making each block exchange data and perform different complex process.

	-"Interoperability", being a norm or standard of SOA, it promotes the use of standardized form so that varying
	users with different equipments could still communicate and be compatible or flexible to mostly everyone.

3. Define Microservices.
	- Simillar to Service Oriented Architechture, Microservices focuses on the same idea as the SOA with the difference
	of it being more distinctly for building individual aplications and not too much for enterprise like SOA,
	Microservices.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.

		-Independently Deployable		-Righ tool for the job
		-Precise scaling

	-"Independently Deployable",this creates small indipendent microservices that communicates with each other
	lessening the size or memory it occupies, making it more compact and efficient for team members to understand
	and modify.

	-"Right tool for the job" implies that because Microservices are independently deployed, people has the freedom
	to choose the most compatible "tool" for the task that could make the task a lot easier with less wasted actions.

	-"Precise Scaling", states that because it is individuality or indepentent nature, services can be scaled up or
	down to its precise amount, making the project more Cost efficient, freeing up memory space and improving performance.
	
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

	- As explained earlier the main difference between SOA and Microservices would be that Service Oriented Architecture
	mainly focuses on the enterprise side or what would you call the transation side while Microservices focuses more on
	individual application creation, in the end it all boils down to their limitations and scope, like how SOA has more
	information, ability, and advantage on an enterprise-wide approach to software development the same can be said to 
	Microservices on its side for independent application building.
