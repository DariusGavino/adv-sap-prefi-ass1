## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).

- In my own explanation service Oriented Architecrure is enterprise-wide, it is known as a reusable software component it means the business can reuse this for upgrading or developing, it is reliable to use for a business. The SOA make easier for developement and any changes in system without affecting the entire system, in other words it is independent design to lessen if problem occur. SOA also can interact with various type of software components. 

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.

- 	1. STANDARDIZED SERVICE CONTRACTS - This will provide a clear and well explained definition of the purpose and the capabilities of the service. This also include on how the process of service, expectations and also some of the restriction of using the system in a formal and standardized service contracts.

	2. LOOSE COUPLING - This will minimize the dependency of components in the system or lessen rellying to each components like service contract, service implementation, and service consumers. Loose Coupling create a specific connection relationship.

	3. ABSTRACTION - This will hide some other details or some other data to avoid the increase of irelevant metadata, or data. In my own opinion it play a big role of designing of service compositions because not all the information is being show and not all the data are accessible for other user just the functions and any other relevant data that may need. 

	4. SERVICE REUSABILITY - From its word 'reusabulity' it can use for developing , upgrading and be more functional for the system. Using this in different application or systems this can also avoid redundancy in development of a software and preserve loosely-coupled in loose coupling, it is convinient to use to explore for diifferent idea on how to improve more. 

	5. AUTONOMY - The autonomy convey on how the functionalities, how to operate the system and any other logic independently and not relying others. This SOA should be marked as important and segregated properly with care.

	6. STATELESSNESS - It refers to independently without relying to others, this service is known more scalable. Statelessness can improve service reuse.

	7. DISCOVERBILITY - This contain suitable metadata to identify and explain the capability to humans/ users. 

	8. COMPOSABILITY - Breaking big problems into little problems to address it step by step and one at a time, splitting it in small can gain the use of reusability principle. This is also a flexible it managed different types of data, exchanging requirements but have similar functions. 

	9. INTEROPERABILITY - This is the standards that all the user can access and communicate, being flexible is a big benefit for user for having different devices/hardware. 

3. Define Microservices 

- Microservice may have simillarities with SOA (Service Oriented Architecture), it collect loosely couples, independently move smaller components or services.In addition microservices is designed to perform a specific function and communicate with other services using protocols. 

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.

-	1. INDEPENDENTLY DEPLOYABLE - This benefit concise and independently microservices, it also resizing into small capacity of memory. Small and precise can modify easily. 

	2. RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB - users can choose right tool that is more in sync for development of the system. Choosing right tool in right situation can lessen time, effort and easy to modify. 

	3. PRECISE SCALING - Being individuality or independent can be pricey somehow, removing or deleting some unused components to free up some space and lessen the cost it may take. 
	

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

- Service Oriented Architecture and Microservices is likely similar but interms of the purpose the SOA is independenly enterprise-wide and uses protocol for communication while Microservices is indendently use for application developement. The similarities they have is both SOA and Microservices breaking down, resizing it to smaller and understandable components.
