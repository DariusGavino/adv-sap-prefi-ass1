## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural approach used in software design and development. It involves creating applications by using services available in a network.


2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.

Reusability: Services in an SOA are designed to be reusable components that can be used in various applications and contexts. This reusability reduces development time and promotes consistency across different parts of a system.
Discoverability: It is the service that is constantly emphasized which is the key to communication between the provider and consumer.


3. Define Microservices.

Microservices is an architectural style for developing software applications as a collection of small, independently deployable, and loosely coupled services.


4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.

Scalability: They go beyond microservices being a popular architectural style for new applications and the cloud being popular hosting destination for new applications.

Microservices are likely to be atleast as popular with executives and project leaders as with developers. Microservices have better reflect the way many business leaders want to structure and run their teams and development processes.


5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

SIMILARITIES
Both SOA and microservices are service based architectures. 

They both loose coupling between services

Both SOA and microservices emphasizes the importance of interoperability

DIFFERENCE
SOA was an enterprise effort to standardize the way all services talk and to integrate with each other while microservices architecture is application specific.

the SOA has an enterprise scope while microservices architecture has an application scope
