## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a business approach to software development that has advantage of reusable software parts and services.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- Characteristics of SOA -
a. Standardized Service Contracts: Services followed to a service type included express their purpose, express their capabalities, and formal used.
b. Loose Coupling: Reducing loosening dependencies between service contract, service implementation and service demand.
c. Abstraction: Positioning and design of service compositions.
d. Service Reusability: Logic is divided by services with maximized reuse.
e. Autonomy: It has primary benefits including increased reliability and behavioral predictability.
f. Statelessness: It adds service scalability.
g. Discoverability: The services discovered usually in a service registry.
h. Composability: Services can break big problems into little problems to reusability principle.
i. Interoperability: The services must use standards that allow subcribers to use the service.

3. Define Microservices.
- Microservices are a truth cloud-native architectural approach, by using them, they can update the code more easily, also it can use different bundle for different parts, and can be scale the parts independently of one another, and many more.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- The Benefits of Using Microservices -
a. Independently deployable: The microservices model suitable neatly with the trend because it can do create small to an organization, cross-functional teams around service, and it can operate an agile fashion.
b. Right tool for the job: An application typically shares a usual stack, with a big, relational database that supports the entire application.
c. Precise scaling: The individual services can be individually deployed but they can be individually scaled.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
- SOA has an enterprise scope while Microservices has an application scope.
- Both SOA and Microservices allow development teams to create build, deploy, and manage modern applications fully for cloud environments.
- Microservices gives precise advantages above SOA deployments.
