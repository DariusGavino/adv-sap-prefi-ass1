## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture

1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
- This is a modularized approach to the use of services through the net in which several processes are segregated into parts to act and provide services as a server.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- The SOA is a combination of a presentation (HTML), logic (PHP), and a data layer (MySQL) in which they act as separate modules. Instead of the usual software services where all functions share the same location, this method modularizes the process. This solves the problem of the monolithic design where it starts to get difficult and harder to maintain as the process gets more complex.

3. Define Microservices.
- The microservices is a method which takes the modularized approach even further where processes are broken down into smaller parts.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- The microservices breaks apart the data and logical layers into smaller pieces. It can allow multiple users to manage different modules or layers without affecting the others. There will be a chance where those users can use different languages at the same time. But, to reduce costs and increase efficiency, most organization limits the number of language used. As microservices expands throughout time, the issue about complexity will arise once again in which the root cause might prove difficult to find. But, there are several available tools that can aid an ever-growing application service.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
- Both the SOA and Microservices utilizes the modularized approach where there is an interface, a logical layer, and a data storage. They also solve the issue that arises in the monolithic method when it comes to more complex systems. But, the microservice approaches this method into an even smaller and detailed scale. In this case, the microservices can grow further and handle more complex processes. Though the use of microservices still depends on the complexity of the planned system. This also means that a monolithic approach is still a viable option for a simpler system.
