## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
It is a software that uses software element that is serves to make a business applications.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
Standardized Service Contracts - It uses metadata for own discovery to communicate the purpose and capabilities to human resources.

Composability - It serves flexible contracts which allows data to exchange demands for same results.

Interoperability - It is the ability of the system or software to change and use of information or data.

Loose Coupling - It is use to minimize the dependencies specific types of relationship and it reduces the dependencies between service contract, implementation and consumers.

Abstraction - It hides the basic information or data as possible. It has a particular role for designing of service compositions.

Service Reusability - It reuse the divided logic into services.

Autonomy - It controls the logic they encapsulate. 

Statelessness - It supports the design and improves the service reuse.

Dicoverability - Services can be discovered.
3. Define Microservices.
Microservice used to build individual applications and it can update code easily. It reduces the waste and cost to scale entire applications.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
Right tool for the job
Precise Scaling 
Independently deployable

It reflects the way many business leaders want to construct and run their teams and development. Microservices are an architectural model that better facilitates a desired operational model.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
In communication SOA Service must share a common communication mechanism. In Microservice each service is developed communication independently.

In Interoperability SOA are more open to heterogenous messaging protocol while Microservice uses lightweight messaging protocol.

In Service Granularity SOA more on wide enterprise services while Microservices is made for specialized services.

In Speed SOA is simple through development and troubleshooting while Microservice minimize sharing favor of duplication.
